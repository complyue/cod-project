# Comprehensive test case: CoD project with full comment support
# This tests the formatter's ability to handle:
# - Project-level comments (general, repo_url before/after, branches before)
# - Dependency-level comments (general, repo_url before/after, branches before)
# - Branch-level comments (before/after each branch)
# - Mixed comment placement and formatting

# Main project comment describing the overall purpose
