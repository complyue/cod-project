# Test case: Nested objects with arrays and formatting issues
# This tests the formatter's ability to handle:
# - Inconsistent spacing around colons (extra spaces before/after)
# - Varying indentation levels (inconsistent depth)
# - Extra spaces around values and quotes
# - Inconsistent array item indentation
# - Mixed quote styles and trailing whitespace
