To build and run the tests with latest source code:

## Test Organization

Tests are organized by component under the `tests/` directory:

- `tests/shilos/` - shilos memory region tests
- `tests/codp/` - CoD package manager tests
- (more component folders will be added later)

## Build Steps

0. In case cod-project main src changed: `cmake --build ./build && ninja -C ./build install` (from root dir of cod-project)
1. `cd tests/<component>` (e.g., `cd tests/shilos` for shilos tests)
2. `mkdir -p build && cmake -G Ninja -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON -B build` (in the component's test directory)
3. `cmake --build ./build`
4. run the test executables

All component test folders use the same cmake build approach for consistency.
