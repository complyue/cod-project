Develop all code for this project using C++20 exclusively. Prioritize modern C++20 language features, idioms, and libraries over legacy approaches. Ensure solutions leverage advancements like concepts, ranges, modules, coroutines, and other C++20-specific enhancements where applicable. Avoid deprecated or outdated patterns unless explicitly justified by edge-case requirements. Optimize for clarity, maintainability, and adherence to contemporary C++ best practices.
